## Simple, solid and certified

We believe setting up and maintaining a complex platform like Kubernetes from scratch is not where the race is won. Just like with Linux, building it once is a good educational experience but not for real use. Kontena Pharos is the complete, maintained and certified Kubernetes distribution that works on-premises, on any cloud and beyond!

## Easy to install, maintain and extend

Kontena Pharos is always up-to-date and built from the latest upstream Kubernetes, including a standardized set of essential features. It is easy to install and maintain with the dedicated CLI tool. The standard deployment may be extended with ready made [add-ons](addons/README.md) for most common use cases, or any extras from the Kubernetes ecosystem!

## 100% Open Source, Support Available

The Kontena Pharos project and tools are open source and released under Apache 2 license. You can use it for free, for any purpose: personal or commercial. You can always find the latest version from our [Github repository](https://github.com/kontena/pharos-cluster).
